# SHWIFTY

For the love of Rick and Morty, Shwifty is a fun and quirky 2D game passion project I did to explore the basics of Unity, featuring entirely self-designed 2D assets inspired by creativity and humor. In this simple game, player takes control of a jumping Pickle Rick and navigate him through an obstacle course of flying knives and other hazards, using the arrow keys to dodge and survive.  

Features:
<ul>
  <li> Original 2D Art: Every asset, from the pickle to the obstacles, is uniquely designed. </li>
  <li> Simple Controls: Use the arrow keys to move and jumpâ€”no complicated mechanics.  </li>
  <li> Endless Gameplay: Dodge knives and keep going for as long as possible to achieve a high score.  </li>
  <li> Casual Fun: A lighthearted project made to enjoy and improve Unity development skills. </li>
</ul>
